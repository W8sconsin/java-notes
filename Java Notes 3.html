<h2>B to C to C++ to Java: An Evolution</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>______ and _______ preceded C.</dt>
  <dd>- B, BCPL.</dd>
  <dt>B was used to write the __________ for Bell Laboratories in 1970.</dt>
  <dd>- Unix operating system.</dd>
  <dt>C came out in the year _________ by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories.</dt>
  <dd>- 1972.</dd>
  <dt>The extension of C called _____ was developed in the 1980s and was can do both object-oriented and procedural programming.</dt>
  <dd>- C++.
  </dd>
  <dt>C++ was used to develop _________ whose success coincided with the explosion of the internet in the mid-1990s.</dt>
  <dd>- Java.
  </dd>

<h2>Steps and Features of Java Development</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>Another term for Java APIs is ___________.</dt>
  <dd>- Java Class Libraries.</dd>
  <dt>What are the five phases of Java development?</dt>
  <dd>- Edit, compile, load, verify, execute.</dd>
  <dt>You type Java source code with what kind of program?</dt>
  <dd>- An editor.</dd>
  <dt>What file ending indicates Java source code?</dt>
  <dd>- .java</dd>
  <dt>Vi and TextPad are examples of what kind of program?</dt>
  <dd>- Editors.</dd>
  <dt>What is an IDE?</dt>
  <dd>- An integrated development environment. IDE offer both text editing and debuggers for locating logical errors.</dd>
  <dt>What are logical errors?</dt>
  <dd>- Logical errors are mistakes in the design of program. They may present itself as the code running but resulting in unanticipated behavior. An example might be incorrect operator precedence.</dd>
  <dt>What does the command javac do?</dt>
  <dd>- Javac compiles a Java program.</dd>
  <dt>Running javac in a command window (shell prompt, Terminal, or Command Prompt) creates files with what kind of file extension?</dt>
  <dd>- .class</dd>
  <dt>What do bytecodes represent?</dt>
  <dd>- The tasks to execute in the execution phase.</dd>
  <dt>What does JVM stand for?</dt>
  <dd>- Java Virtual Machine.</dd>
  <dt>What is a virtual machine?</dt>
  <dd>- A virtual machine simulates a computer within another computer.  It is also known as a guest while the "real" computer that it operates in is known as a "host".</dd>
  <dt>What does the "java" command do?</dt>
  <dd>- It invokes the JVM and executes a Java application.</dd>
  <dt>What does a class loader do?</dt>
  <dd>- It puts Java classes into primary memory.</dd>
  <dt>What is a bytecode verifier?</dt>
  <dd>- It verifies security of the bytecodes and checks that they are valid.</dd>
  <dt>How do today's JVMs execute code?</dt>
  <dd>- They use a combination of JIT (just-in-time) compilation and slower traditional interpretation.</dd>
  <dt>Define JIT (just-in-time) compilation.</dt>
  <dd>- Hot spots (frequently execute stretches) are identified in the code. These get turned into machine code first, so that these stretches don't need to get reinterpreted. This speeds up execution.</dd>

<dl>
  <dt>IBM developed ___________ in the 1950s for scientific and engineering applications.  It's still in use.</dt>
  <dd>- Fortran (short for Formula Translation).</dd>
  <dt>Developed in the 1960s, _______________ is still used in some business software.</dt>
  <dd>- COBOL (short for Common Business Object Language).</dd>
  <dt>In 1971, Niklaus Wirth developed __________, which was popular in academia.</dt>
  <dd>- Pascal.</dd>
  <dt>The US Department of Defense developed __________ for military purposes in the 1970s and early 80s.</dt>
  <dd>- Ada.</dd>
  <dt>Ada is named after Lord Byron's daughter.  Why is she famous?</dt>
  <dd>- She is credited with writing the world's first computer program for Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine mechanical computing device.</dd>
  <dt>Ada introduced multitasking.  What is that?</dt>
  <dd>- Specifying that many activities happen in parallel.</dd>
  <dt>What does BASIC, a language developed in the 1960s, stand for?</dt>
  <dd>- Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.</dd>
  <dt>Name four languages created by Microsoft.</dt>
  <dd>- Visual Basic, Visual C++, and C#.</dd>
  <dt>What is the aim of Microsoft's .NET platform?</dt>
  <dd>- Allowing programmers to write in the language that they are most familiar with. Interchangeable of components written in different langugages.</dd>
  <dt>C# is based on _________ and ___________.</dt>
  <dd>- C#, Java.</dd>
