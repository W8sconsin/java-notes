<h2>Java - Trivia about the language</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>What company created Java?</dt>
  <dd>- Sun Microsystems</dd>
  <dt>What are Java EE, Java SE, and Java ME for?</dt>
  <dd>- Enterprise Edition is for enterprises.  Standard Edition is for the general uses and broad purposes.  Micro Edition is for small, memory constrained devices like pagers and cell phones.</dd>

<h2>Computer Logical Units</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>What are the logical units of a computer?</dt>
  <dd>- There are 6 logical computers to a computer: input, output, memory, ALU (Arithmetic and logic unit), CPU (Central Processing Unit), and secondary storage.</dd>
  <dt>Why do we say that the memory unit is volatile?</dt>
  <dd>- Because typically when a computer is turned off, information in the memory unit is lost.</dd>
  <dt>In which other unit is does the ALU typically live in modern computers?</dt>
  <dd>- In the CPU.</dd>
  <dt>What is a multiprocessor?</dt>
  <dd>- A computer with more than one CPU on a single integrated circuit chip. It can thus perform many operations simultaneously.</dd>
  <dd>What does "persistent" mean as refers to secondary storage?</dd>
  <dt>Secondary storage is for long-term warehousing of data, as opposed to the memory unit with its volatile - or readily loseable - storage.</dt>

<h2>History of Computing and Operating Systems</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>What is batch processing and when was its hayday?</dt>
  <dd>- In the 1950s. Batch processing is performing one kind of task at a time. It still exists today with credit card batching, for example.</dd>
  <dt>What is throughput?</dt>
  <dd>- The amount of work that computers perform at one time.</dd>
  <dt>What is multiprogramming?</dt>
  <dd>- When "jobs" compete in a computer for a computer's resource. This improved computing efficiency.</dd>
  <dt>What was timesharing?</dt>
  <dd>- A single computer was accessed by many user terminals, doing a little bit of one terminal's work before hopping to the next terminal's work and then to the next, and so on. This create the appearance of every user's work being done at the same time.</dd>
