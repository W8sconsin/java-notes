<h2>The Basics of Programming Languages</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>What are the three general types of programming languages?</dt>
  <dd>- Machine, assembly, and high-level.</dd>
  <dt>Which of the three is Java?</dt>
  <dd>- Java is a high-level language.</dd>
  <dt>What type of language is natively understood by a computer?</dt>
  <dd>- Machine language. The famous ones and zeroes.</dd>
  <dt>What do we mean when we say machine language is machine dependent?</dt>
  <dd>- Machine languages are specific to the type of machine or device that they are designed for. Other language may be machine independent or cross-platform, usable by many systems.
  </dd>
  <dt>What is an assembler?</dt>
  <dd>- An assembler is a translator program that converts assembly language into machine language.
  </dd>
  <dt>What do compilers do?</dt>
  <dd>- Compilers convert high-level language into machine language, using an intermediate object that they create. Java and C are compiled languages and use compilers.
  </dd>
  <dt>What is an interpreter program?</dt>
  <dd>- Slower than compilers, interpreters are used with languages like Ruby, JavaScript, and Python. They translate to machine code without creating an intermediate object, so they are more memory efficient. They are more debugging friendly, too. Compilers stop when they hit their first translation error.
