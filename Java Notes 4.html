<h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>What is UML?</dt>
  <dd>- Unified Modeling Language is a graphical language for designing software systems to industry standards.</dd>
  <dt>What is an object?</dt>
  <dd>- An object is composed of attributes and behaviors that are related.  For instance, a "person" object has attributes &mdash; height, weight, IQ, age &mdash; and behaviors &mdash; sleep(), eat(), saySomething().</dd>
  <dt>Define OOD.</dt>
  <dd>- Object-oriented design is a practice that models software after real-world objects.</dd>
  <dt>In OOD, let's represent a vehicle using class and object relationships. A vehicle is a ________ and its subunits &mdash; cars, trucks, wagons, motorcycles &mdash; are called ___________.</dt>
  <dd>- Class, objects.</dd>
  <dt>What is inheritance?</dt>
  <dd>- Getting characteristics in a child class from a parent class.</dd>
  <dt>Can objects communicate with one another?</dt>
  <dd>- Yes, they can, via messages.</dd>
  <dt>What is encapsulation?</dt>
  <dd>- Wrapping behaviors (operations) and attributes in objects.</dd>
  <dt>Why is information hiding an important feature of objects?</dt>
  <dd>- It prevents other code from screwing up the inner workings of objects.</dd>
  <dt>What is an interface?</dt>
  <dd>- This defines communications between objects.</dd>
  <dt>How does procedural programming differ from OOP?</dt>
  <dd>- Procedural programming is designed around actions. It is action-oriented. C is a procedural language. The unit of programmin in C is the function.</dd>
  <dt>A Java class implements operations as ______ and attributes as _________.</dt>
  <dd>- Methods, fields.</dd>
  <dt>Instantiation is what?</dt>
  <dd>- Creating objects.</dd>
  <dt>What is a client?</dt>
  <dd>- It is a class that uses another class.</dd>
  <dt>Classes are to objects as blueprints are to _____________.</dt>
  <dd>- Houses.</dd>
  <dt>What are associations?</dt>
  <dd>- Relationships between classes.</dd>
  <dt>What are components?</dt>
  <dd>- Groups of classes that can be reused by developers.</dd>
