<h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>What is UML?</dt>
  <dd>- Unified Modeling Language is a graphical language for designing software systems to industry standards.</dd>
  <dt>What is an object?</dt>
  <dd>- An object is composed of attributes and behaviors that are related.  For instance, a "person" object has attributes &mdash; height, weight, IQ, age &mdash; and behaviors &mdash; sleep(), eat(), saySomething().</dd>
  <dt>Define OOD.</dt>
  <dd>- Object-oriented design is a practice that models software after real-world objects.</dd>
  <dt>In OOD, let's represent a vehicle using class and object relationships. A vehicle is a ________ and its subunits &mdash; cars, trucks, wagons, motorcycles &mdash; are called ___________.</dt>
  <dd>- Class, objects.</dd>
  <dt>What is inheritance?</dt>
  <dd>- Getting characteristics in a child class from a parent class.</dd>
  <dt>Can objects communicate with one another?</dt>
  <dd>- Yes, they can, via messages.</dd>
  <dt>What is encapsulation?</dt>
  <dd>- Wrapping behaviors (operations) and attributes in objects.</dd>
  <dt>Why is information hiding an important feature of objects?</dt>
  <dd>- It prevents other code from screwing up the inner workings of objects.</dd>
  <dt>What is an interface?</dt>
  <dd>- This defines communications between objects.</dd>
  <dt>How does procedural programming differ from OOP?</dt>
  <dd>- Procedural programming is designed around actions. It is action-oriented. C is a procedural language. The unit of programmin in C is the function.</dd>
  <dt>A Java class implements operations as ______ and attributes as _________.</dt>
  <dd>- Methods, fields.</dd>
  <dt>Instantiation is what?</dt>
  <dd>- Creating objects.</dd>
  <dt>What is a client?</dt>
  <dd>- It is a class that uses another class.</dd>
  <dt>Classes are to objects as blueprints are to _____________.</dt>
  <dd>- Houses.</dd>
  <dt>What are associations?</dt>
  <dd>- Relationships between classes.</dd>
  <dt>What are components?</dt>
  <dd>- Groups of classes that can be reused by developers.</dd>
  <dt>What is pseudocode?</dt>
  <dd>- Pseudocode is informal notation used to plan pieces of program without having to write code yet.</dd>
  <dt>What organization promotes the standardization of object-oriented technologies?</dt>
  <dd>- Object Management Group (OMG).</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Web 2.0</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>When was the first Web 2.0 conference?</dt>
  <dd>- 2004.</dd>
  <dt>What is a "mashup"?</dt>
  <dd>- A mashup combines individual web services from different organizations into a combine resource for developing websites and other technologies.</dd>
  <dt>Define a "web service".</dt>
  <dd>- A web service is a source of data that a website can consume.</dd>
  <dt>What is AJAX?</dt>
  <dd>- Although, it actually predates the Web 2.0 period, it really emerged contemporaneously in around 2005. AJAX allows you to do things in the background of website without having to reload a page.</dd>
  <dt>What is an RSS feed?</dt>
  <dd>- A technology that allows companies to push content to subscribers.</dd>
  <dt>What do RSS and AJAX stand for?</dt>
  <dd>- Really Simple Syndication, and Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Software Potpourri</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>What is Agile Software Development?</dt>
  <dd>- A methodology to rapidly get a minimum viable product out and then iteratively improve upon it rather than depending on traditional waterfall projects.</dd>
  <dt>To refactor code means what?</dt>
  <dd>- Refactoring means rewriting code to make it cleaner without changing existing functionality.</dd>
  <dt>What is a design pattern</dt>
  <dd>- A design pattern is a proven setup for an application architecture.</dd>
  <dt>What is open-source software?</dt>
  <dd>- Open-source technology allows editing of source code by companies and individuals, and the technology is freeish. This opens technologies to more people scrutinizing, and technologies are able to get refined and debugged more quickly.</dd>
  <dt>What operating system is considered by many to be the crowning achievement of open-source?</dt>
  <dd>- Linux.</dd>
  <dt>MySQL is an open-source ______________ used in the ____________ Stack.</dt>
  <dd>- Database Management System, LAMP.</dd>
  <dt>Ruby is a _____________ and Rails is a __________________.</dt>
  <dd>- Scripting language, web application framework.</dd>
  <dt>What is SAAS (Software as a Service)? </dt>
  <dd>- SAAS is a model that allows companies to provide software to companies without the companies having to install and maintain it (as much) locally. The software lives in the provider's servers.</dd>
